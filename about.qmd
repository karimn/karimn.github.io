I am an economist/data scientist with 9+ years of experience in **causal inference**, **experiment design**, and **statistical modeling**. Currently applying advanced Bayesian methods in oncology drug development at AstraZeneca. Expert in building **hierarchical state-space models**, **survival analysis**, and **clinical trial analytics** using R, Stan, and Julia. Experienced in using **Bayesian networks** for causal identification in experimental and non-experimental contexts. Proficient in **reinforcement learning** for partially observable environments. Focused on rigorous quantification of uncertainty for decision-making.

**Reinforcement Learning for Intervention Optimization (2022-2023)**

* Designed and built a [Julia package](https://www.github.com/karimn/FundingPOMDPs.jl) for a reinforcement learning solution (partially observable Markov decision process), using Monte Carlo tree search, to optimize intervention implementation and evaluation decisions
* Used Bayesian hierarchical models to predict future states in POMDP
* Used particle filters for faster online planning
* Project writeup: [The Funder's Meta-Problem](https://karimn.github.io/effective-funding/funder-meta-problem-1.html)
* [Implemented](https://github.com/karimn/grokking-drl) various deep reinforcement learning agents and models using Julia and Flux.jl

* Designed and built continuous randomized experiments to estimate and predict demand and supply elasticity in real estate markets. These were the principal models used in determining offers for home buying/selling.
* Used Gaussian processes to construct nonlinear time-series prediction models. 
* Used hierarchical models to capture heterogeneity in different markets, offer types, etc.
* Designed a survival and time-series model to capture the duration homes are on the market and how this affects elasticity.
* Solicited stakeholders to capture prior beliefs about both the structure of models and distributional uncertainty, which is critical in facilitating decision-making in small data environments.
* Designed non-experimental causal identification strategies for contexts where experiment manipulation is not possible.

* [Built](https://www.github.com/karimn/takeup) a structural Bayesian model representing a behavior model, using data from a large-scale social experiment conducted in Kenya.
* Worked on authoring an economics research paper on findings from the experiment.
* [Built](https://github.com/karimn/covid-19-transmission) a hierarchical model to evaluate the effectiveness of a scaled economic intervention program in Bangladesh.
* Used Gaussian processes to model correlation in intervention effects based on spatial proximity.
* Designed and built a hierarchical model investigating the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission in different countries under different stay-at-home restrictions.
* [Used](https://github.com/karimn/vaccine-model-fit) a simulated method of moments approach to fit the AcceleratingHT model‚Äôs parameters to the CGD model‚Äôs predictions of vaccine success.
* Implemented R [package](https://www.github.com/karimn/boundr) for bounded identification of counterfactuals, in directed acyclic graphs, in the presence of imperfect compliance with experimental treatment assignment.
