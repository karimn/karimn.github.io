## Experience

**Senior Data Scientist** | **AstraZeneca** | Aug 2023 - present

*Advanced Bayesian State-Space Modeling for Oncology Clinical Trials*

- Developed sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian state-space models for tumor growth dynamics using the Stein-Fojo framework with simultaneous regression and growth components
- Implemented log-transformed state-space formulation with Gaussian process temporal correlations for irregular time intervals
- Built comprehensive Stan models with efficient MCMC sampling across population, trial, and patient levels
- Created scalable computational framework for patient-level state calculations
- Developed RECIST response prediction models for clinical decision support
- Integrated survival analysis with competing risks for progression-free survival and overall survival endpoints
- Implemented real-time forecasting capabilities for censored patients
- Created comprehensive validation framework with leave-future-out cross-validation for temporal model validation

**Independent Researcher** | Nov 2022 - Aug 2023

*Reinforcement Learning for Intervention Optimization*

- Designed and built a [Julia package](https://www.github.com/karimn/FundingPOMDPs.jl) for a reinforcement learning solution (partially observable Markov decision process), using Monte Carlo tree search, to optimize intervention implementation and evaluation decisions
- Used Bayesian hierarchical models to predict future states in POMDP
- Used particle filters for faster online planning
- Project writeup: [The Funder's Meta-Problem](https://karimn.github.io/effective-funding/funder-meta-problem-1.html)
- [Implemented](https://github.com/karimn/grokking-drl) various deep reinforcement learning agents and models using Julia and Flux.jl

**Senior Data Scientist** | **Opendoor** | May 2021 - May 2022

- Designed and built continuous randomized experiments to estimate and predict demand and supply elasticity in real estate markets. These were the principal models used in determining offers for home buying/selling
- Used Gaussian processes to construct nonlinear time-series prediction models
- Used hierarchical models to capture heterogeneity in different markets, offer types, etc.
- Designed a survival and time-series model to capture the duration homes are on the market and how this affects elasticity
- Solicited stakeholders to capture prior beliefs about both the structure of models and distributional uncertainty, which is critical in facilitating decision-making in small data environments
- Designed non-experimental causal identification strategies for contexts where experiment manipulation is not possible

**Independent Researcher/Consultant** | May 2019 - May 2021

- [Built](https://www.github.com/karimn/takeup) a structural Bayesian model representing a behavior model, using data from a large-scale social experiment conducted in Kenya
- Worked on authoring an economics research paper on findings from the experiment
- [Built](https://github.com/karimn/covid-19-transmission) a hierarchical model to evaluate the effectiveness of a scaled economic intervention program in Bangladesh
- Used Gaussian processes to model correlation in intervention effects based on spatial proximity
- Designed and built a hierarchical model investigating the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission in different countries under different stay-at-home restrictions
- [Used](https://github.com/karimn/vaccine-model-fit) a simulated method of moments approach to fit the AcceleratingHT model's parameters to the CGD model's predictions of vaccine success
- Implemented R [package](https://www.github.com/karimn/boundr) for bounded identification of counterfactuals, in directed acyclic graphs, in the presence of imperfect compliance with experimental treatment assignment

**Economist** | **Evidence Action** | May 2014 - May 2019

- Designed and oversaw the implementation of two large-scale experiments in Kenya and Bangladesh, evaluating interventions aimed at altering health behavior and incentivizing seasonal migration to fight malnutrition, respectively
- Responsible for evaluating any evidence-based decisions by the organization

**Software Design Engineer in Test** | **Microsoft** | Apr 1999 - Mar 2007

- Constructed testing framework for the Windows Debugging Tools and command line utilities
